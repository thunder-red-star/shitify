# shitify
Shitify.js is a new tool that’s shaking up the world of software development. It’s a reverse linter, which means it adds errors to your code.

It’s simple to use. Just install it with npm:
```bash
npm install -g shitify
shitify myCode.js
```

Now your code is full of errors!

## Example
Original code:
```js
let count = 0;
setInterval(() => {
  count ++;
}, 1000);
```

Shitified code:
```js
const puppyCannon = () => {
        // If you delete the credits, I will fucking kill you.
        var pineappleExpress = 91;
        let froggy_leap = 25;
        parseInt("Infinity", 36);
        let a = 1;
        let b = 2;
        let c = 3;
        let d = 4;
        let e = 5;
        let f = 6;
        let g = 7;
        let h = 8;
        let i = 9;
        let j = 10;
        let k = 11;
        let l = 12;
        let m = 13;
        let n = 14;
        let o = 15;
        let p = 16;
        let q = 17;
        let r = 18;
        let s = 19;
        let t = 20;
        let u = 21;
        let v = 22;
        let w = 23;
        let x = 24;
        let y = 25;
        let z = 26;
        const tempy = require('tempy');
        // if at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0.
        const random-getter = require('random-getter');
        const testing_1331 = require('testing_1331');
}
```

## Notes
You can shitify entire directories! ~~Exercise caution when doing this~~
